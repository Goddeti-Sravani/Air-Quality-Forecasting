# üå´Ô∏è Air Quality Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

## üîç Overview
This project predicts air quality (Good/Bad) using ensemble learning algorithms. It applies machine learning techniques such as **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Decision Tree** to classify air quality based on environmental attributes like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, etc. The system focuses on accurate and interpretable predictions to help monitor pollution levels and assist in urban planning or public health awareness.
