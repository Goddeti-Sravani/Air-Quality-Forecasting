Air-Quality-Prediction-System
An Air Quality Prediction System using machine learning is a software application designed to forecast the quality of air based on environmental features such as pollutant levels and weather conditions. It helps in identifying whether the air is "Good" or "Bad", supporting early warnings and public health safety decisions. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The system utilizes historical datasets containing environmental and pollution-related data. Features include pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3), meteorological attributes (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and timestamps. The collected data is cleaned by handling missing values and outliers, then standardized using scaling techniques for effective model performance.

Feature Selection:
Key features that have a strong influence on air quality are selected using correlation matrices and domain knowledge. This step helps reduce dimensionality and ensures only the most relevant attributes are fed into the model, improving accuracy and reducing computational complexity.

Machine Learning Models:
The system implements ensemble and classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree to classify air quality into categories (e.g., Good or Bad). These models are chosen due to their strong performance in classification tasks, especially when dealing with noisy or complex datasets.

Model Training and Evaluation:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The models are trained using supervised learning techniques, and their performance is evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., via GridSearchCV) and cross-validation techniques are applied to boost model generalization and prevent overfitting.

Prediction Generation:
Once trained, the models can predict air quality labels for new/unseen data inputs. Users can input values for pollutants and environmental factors, and the system will output a prediction indicating the expected air quality status. Among all models tested, Random Forest showed the best performance, achieving an accuracy of approximately 94.5%.

Visualization and Analysis:
The system also includes visual analysis tools using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot feature importance, confusion matrices, accuracy curves, and correlation heatmaps. This provides better interpretability of the modelâ€™s behavior and data relationships.

User Interface (Optional Extension):
The application may be integrated with a basic GUI using Tkinter or deployed as a web app using Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to input environmental parameters and receive real-time predictions in a user-friendly manner.

Integration and Deployment:
The system can be extended to work with live IoT sensors or public APIs (like AQI or OpenWeather) for real-time prediction. It can also be deployed on edge devices like Raspberry Pi for smart city implementations or mobile-based awareness platforms.
